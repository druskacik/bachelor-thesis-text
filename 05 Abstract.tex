In our thesis we analyse a particular class of statistical experiments, where for all combinations of two qualitative factors we select one of two possible treatments. 
This experiment can be modelled as a linear regression. The key theoretical theorem, which we use in the practical section of our thesis, is the Gauss-Markov theorem. 
The goal is to analyse the contrast between the two types of treatment and to find those designs of experiment that allow the best possible estimate of this contrast. 
Designs of experiment are represented by binary matrices.
